# Math and Data Structures

## Introduction

This is a C# library for advanced math and data structures.<br>
It starts as a little project and, how knows, maybe one day will be a professional thing. :)
<br>

## Status
Now it is in an embrional phase, I just coded partially:
- Matrix
- Undirected Graph

## Future Works

In the future I plan to add all the data structures that are not in the .NET framework, such as:
- Heap
- Tree and BTree
- Directed Graph
- Etc...

And some advanced math, such as:
- Gaussian Random
- Equations and Disequations
- Limits
- Derivates
- Integrals
- Some linear algebra things
- Etc...
